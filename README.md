# My Reads Project

This is the first project of the React Developer Nanodegree Program.


The project is about keeping track of somebody's reading. It's a React based web site where you can register the books you've already read, the ones you want to read and the books you are currently reading. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites and Installing

To get the project running, you have to install Node.js and NPM on your machine to install some packages. 

To check if you have Node.js already installed on your computer, open your cmd and type on your command line node -v and hit enter. If you already have Node.js on your machine, it'll appear the version of the Node.js you have on your machine.

To check if you have NPM already installed on your computer, open your cmd and type on your command line npm -v and hit enter. If you already have NPM on your machine, it'll appear the version of the Node.js you have on your machine.

$ node -v
$ npm -v

If you prefer, you might want to install Yarn, which is similar to Node.js, but a little bit faster.

If you don't have Node/Yarn and NPM installed, you'll nedd to install them:

Open Node.js website on your browser: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Choose your platform and your system requirements (32-bits ou 64-bits).

By clicking to install Node.js, choose the directory where the instalation will take place, and then open the downloaded file and go through the istalation steps (by default, you'll just have to keep clicking "Next").

By doing that, you'll have installed Node.js and NPM on your machine. But, in case you want to install Yarn, open your cmd and type:

$ npm install yarn

After that you can open the project directory and get it tested and running, but you'll have to do just one more step and type on your command line and press enter:

$ npm install

You need to do it because the node modules folder is too big to get uploaded, so you'll have to install it manually to install all the project dependencies.

## Running the tests

After you do all those step, you'll be able to test the app.

On the command line, run the app:

$ yarn start
